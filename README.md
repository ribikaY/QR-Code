## My process

- First, I broke down the user interface into components. 
- After dividing the UI into components, I began working on the HTML structure. With the HTML structure in place, I assigned appropriate classes to the HTML elements.
- Then, I started working on the CSS using Mobile-First Approach. After completing the mobile styling, I worked on the desktop version of the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
